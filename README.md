# Offensive Tools Installation Script

### Overview

This script is designed to automate the installation of essential "offensive tools" for penetration testing, ethical hacking, password cracking, blue teaming, red teaming, and related activities. It has been tested on Debian 12 but should work on similar Debian-based distributions.

Additionally, the script sets up a monthly cron job to keep installed tools updated automatically.
